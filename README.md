# Apache Kafka Kotlin Examples

This repository has example projects created for the [Apache Kafka for Beginners V2](https://www.udemy.com/course/apache-kafka/) course
on Udemy. Each example is a separate gradle module.

Further instructions are in the README.md of each module.

All of these projects require a local installation of Apache Kafka and Apache Zookeeper, except for the Confluent Cloud examples.
